<!-- In JavaScript, we have access to a function called document.querySelector. 
 And what document.querySelector is going to do is it is going to give us the ability to look through an HTML page and extract 
 an element out of that page so that we can manipulate that HTML element using JavaScript code. And so if I want to select like an
  h1 element, I can say document.querySelector. 

And then as the argument, the input to document.querySelector, I'll go ahead and say each one, meaning go through the page, find me an
 h1 element. And querySelector is only going to return one element, so if there are multiple, it's going to return the first thing it 
 finds. But here, we only have one h1 element, so it's OK. I'm going to say look through this document, try and find an h1 element, and 
 when you do, I'd like to manipulate it. And the way I'd like to manipulate it is by saying .innerHTML =, let's say, goodbye, for example. 
 
 Event Listeners (addEventListener)

 What it does:

Listens for an event (e.g., click, submit, keydown, etc.).
Executes a function (callback) when the event happens.

querySelector – Selecting Elements

 What it does:

document.querySelector(selector) selects the first matching element.
document.querySelectorAll(selector) selects all matching elements (returns a NodeList).
It’s a modern alternative to getElementById or getElementsByClassName.
