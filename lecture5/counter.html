<!-- It turns out JavaScript does the same thing, just with slightly different syntax. It doesn't use f. Instead of using the regular quotation marks or the single or 
 double quotation marks, JavaScript uses these backticks, which are usually located above the Tab key on a standard US keyboard. 

And this is going to create what JavaScript calls a template literal, where I can then substitute the value of a variable somewhere inside of this template. And then 
in order to actually do the substitution, while Python uses double curly braces to say plug-in the value of counter right here, JavaScript does something similar. It 
also uses double curly braces, but there needs to be dollar sign in front of it. The dollar sign, and then the double curly braces mean go ahead and plug-in the value of a 
variable there.  -->
